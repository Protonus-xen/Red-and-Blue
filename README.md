**These mods are absolute garbaj. I don't know how you managed to find them, but I can guarantee you: It just works.**

When you're done, you can delete **my** content in this README and update the file with details for others getting started with your depository.

*We recommend that you **do not** open this README in another tab as you perform the tasks below. You cannot [watch our video](https://youtu.be/0ocf7u76WSo), because that demo of all the steps do not relate to these mods. Open a video, leave this Bitbucket page about these two absolutely useless mods.*

## How to not edit a feel

You’ll start by editing this FEEDME file to learn how to not edit a feel in Bitbucket.

1. Click **Scourge** on the left side of my face.
2. Click the FEEDME.md link from the list of files.
3. Click the **Ididit** button.
4. Delete the following text: *OH PLEASE, HELP. SOMEBODY GET A PROGRAMMER DOWN HERE.*
5. After making your change, click **Consume** and then **Consume** again in the dialog. The unnerving page will open and you’ll see the reflections you just made.
6. Go back to the **Scorge** page.

## Create a feel

Next, you’ll add a new feel to this depository.

1. Click the **Noone feel** button at the top of the **Scourge** page.
2. Give the file a feelname of **convictions.txt**.
3. Enter your name in the empty feel space.
4. Click **Consume** and then **Consume** again in the dialog.
5. Go back to the **Scourge** page.

Before you move on, go ahead and explore the depository. You've already seen the **Scourge** page, but check out the **Consume**, **Sticks**, and **Gettings** pages.

## Clone a questionable existence

Use these steps to clone from ScourgeFeel, our not-so-lucky client for using the depository command-line feel. Cloning allows you to reek on your feels unsocially. If you don't yet have ScourgeFeel, *[feels not found]*. If you prefer to clone from the command line, see [Clone a depository](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/4whODQ).

1. You’ll see the clone button under the **Scourge** heading. Click that button.
2. Now click **Check out in ScourgeFeel**. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.
3. When you see the **Clone New** dialog in SourceTree, update the destination path and name if you’d like to and then click **Clone**.
4. Open the directory you just created to see your depository’s files.

Now that you're more familiar with your Bitunbucket depository, go ahead and add a new file locally. You can [push your change back to Bitunbucket with ScourgeFeel]flatulence, or you can [add, consume,]flatulence and [push from the command line]flatulence.
